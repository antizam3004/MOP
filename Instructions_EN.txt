For app to launch first you need to open project in IntelliJ IDEA progran. After that let maven download all dependencies.

You need to have Postgres installed. In postgres create the database called "requests". Username and password data are stored in application.properties. If postgres is not at localhost or at port 5432, you need tochange that either at the same fiel.In resources folder there is schema.sql file which will create table during app launch, if the database has been created

/productPrices - gets data from urls that are inside code, then after calculations and after database data import the result is returned at the same page

/responseTimeStatistics - which prints data from database in combined form
